b) 

for dx = 1/10, dy = 1/10, dt = 1/20
 u = 0.95370
for dx = 1/15, dy = 1/15, dt = 1/25
 u = 0.95438
for dx = 1/20, dy = 1/20, dt = 1/30
 u = -1.7613E34

No, this is unstable and does not converge. The reason for this instability is because of dt not being small enough. Make it smaller, then it will converge.


c)

At  0.5 => avg = 0.991799
At  3   => avg = 0.964032
At  10  => avg = 0.935709
At  20  => avg = 0.924895
At  40  => avg = 0.922111
