%% Program 12 Supplement: Matlab function file to plot the
%% u versus (x,y) data from program12.cpp
%%
%% Inputs:
%% N, M              Grid parameters for solution
%% program12.out     Data file from program12.cpp; first
%%                   few lines of text must be removed
%%                   from file before using.
%%
%% Outputs:
%% prog12_Cmap.pdf   PDF file of contour map of u(x,y)
%%
%%
%% Here's how to get started:
%%
%%  1) Copy matlab12.m (this file) into your working directory.
%%
%%  2) Launch the software MATLAB by typing "matlab" at the
%%     Linux prompt in your working directory.  (The math 
%%     dept machines have this software installed.)  This
%%     may take a few seconds -- you should get a MATLAB
%%     window with a prompt that looks like ">>".
%%
%%  3) Adjust the values of N,M below.  Remove the first
%%     few lines of text from program12.out.
%%
%%  4) To run this program, type "matlab12" at the prompt in 
%%     the MATLAB window.
%%
%%  5) After the program runs, the results will be displayed
%%     on the screen and saved in the file "prog12_Cmap.pdf" 
%%     in your working directory.
%%
%%  6) To re-run the program, just type "matlab12" at the
%%     MATLAB prompt again.  If you are using a new data file,
%%     remember to remove the first few lines of text.
